There are a few special help words, which do not resolve to a command, but instead cause another function to run. These special words are used in the following form: `%help <word>`, where `<word>` is the special word.

* `PokestarBot`: This is the same as entering the help command without any arguments.
* `commands`: Shows the output of the help command without this message.
* `with_cog` / `withcog`: Shows the output of the help command with their Cogs. A Cog is a grouping of commands that share similar functionality. You can get the commands for a Cog with the help command, by doing `%help <CogName>`.
* `cog_list` / `coglist`: Shows the list of cogs.
* `all`: Shows all commands, even ones that you cannot run.
